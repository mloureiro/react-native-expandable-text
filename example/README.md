# React Native Expandable Text Example

This example is based on [expo and typescript](https://github.com/janaagaard75/expo-and-typescript).

## Prerequisites

Install `expo-cli` globally.

```shell
# Install expo-cli globally using Yarn.
yarn global add expo-cli
```

If you prefer to use npm the command is `npm install --global expo-cli`.

## Running the App

Start the local server. This will give you a QR code that you can scan using the Expo Client app on your mobile device.

```shell
yarn start
```

If you're on a Mac and have Xcode installed, you can run the app using the iOS Simulator with the following command.

```shell
yarn ios
```
